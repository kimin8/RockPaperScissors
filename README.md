following options: "<b>rock</b>", "<b>paper</b>" or "<b>scissors</b>". The rules are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Rock beats scissors</b> (the scissors get broken by the rock)</li>
  <li><b>Paper beats rock</b> (the paper covers the rock)</li>
  <li><b>Scissors beat paper</b> (the paper gets cut by the scissors)</li>
</ul>

<p>The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of their opponent. If both players choose the same option, the game ends in a draw.</p>
